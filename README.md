# Web Printer
A user friendly web printing service.

### What's that?
The name is quite self-explanatory, it's a web service, to which you upload pdf file and it will print the pdf using the printer (physically) connected to it.

### But why I need it?
You may already have a fancy printer with cutting-edge wireless printing function, but sadly, we don't. To be specific, the old fashined printer in my lab is manufactured at 2006 and its network priting is definitly showing its age (even the smartest guy in our lab cannot properly config it).

Apart from this, we want a web service which can properly handle remote printing requests without pain.

### How to setup
Well, the service is deployed on a Mac next to the printer but technically, you may deploy it on any Linux machine. If you happened to use Windows, you are definitely smart enough to install a linux virtual machine and attached the printer to it :)
